Check [https://github.com/pkhead/rained/releases] for any new releases. If you want to update it, you should remove and replace all the files and folders from this installation folder EXCEPT:
- preferences.json
- imgui.ini
- Data/
- logs/

Also, this is still in beta, so expect changes and bugs. Please report bugs, complaints, and suggestions by creating an issue or pinging @chromosoze in the Rain World Discord server.

Other than that, I don't have much to put on here. Hope you like it!
