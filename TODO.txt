Bugs:
- client code mouse position doesn't work with multi-viewport
- Someone got this stack trace:

  System.Exception: The uniform type is not a sampler

Overall:
- dissolve material/tile separation
- be able to view shortcut geo outside of the geometry editor
- does update checker notif window timing work?
- auto purge old log files
- prop selection box is affected by bfTiles (don't do this, also make optional from preferences. is this possible?)
- material previews. henry said i shouldn't try it because it will make the leditor very slow but I Don't Care.
  (i  mean i do care, i just think i can make it run reasonably fast by using spatial partitioning)
- autotiles
  - option to join only inner tiles
  - ability to recognize more than one tile as a direction type
  - cross beams autotile
    - ability to constrain autotile shape into a square
- method of generating approximated geometry from prop
- new level screen
- favorite tiles and props
- Move Level
- undo/redo for level resize
- level resze drag
- level resize change history
- help pages/hints/tooltips/whatever
- tile cat# and index# saving is probably incorrect
- option to use "legacy" shortcut icons
- put asterik in window title for unsaved levels
- ability to have more than one level loaded at once

Glib:
- shader class should keep a list of texture slots. when Use() is called, re-set the texture units based on this list.

Geometry Editor:
- fill
- select and copy/paste
- show tool preview over mouse
- select and move geometry (make in conjunction with copy/paste)
- keyboard shortcut for shortcut & shortcut dots

Light Editor:
- toggle view shadow plane and occlusion plane
- prop/tile as brush

Effects Editor:
- WASD navigation
- only store the pixels that changed in the matrix

Prop Editor:
- do tile as prop depth change based on if specs2 is active?
- More tiles are located in startUp.lingo... also check out initDRInternal in comEditorUtils.lingo
- correct flipping of multiple props or freeform props
  freeform props should flip about the center of the AABB
