Bugs:
- chain holder undo/redo is broken
- reported issue of lag building up over time... speeds up when opened a room with a lot of props
- reported increased usage while computer is locked
- removing a tile also removes the material underneath it
- reported crash in asset manager due to queues or something
- fix double resource disposal on window close
- render preview sometimes crashes
  (DebugCheck): Setting invalid uniform (handle  11)
  Invalid handle. submit handle: 19 (max 512)   (repeated many times, as this error doesn't cause a crash)
- linux/vulkan resizing looks weird... also sometimes creates segfault i guess
- file browser window is too big on high dpi

Overall:
- dissolve material/tile separation
- be able to view shortcut geo outside of the geometry editor
- does update checker notif window timing work?
- shortcut to toggle tile graphics (suggested: ctrl+shift+t)
- auto-updater
- logging
  - button to show latest log file
  - log window shows rained logs
- prop selection box is affected by bfTiles (don't do this, also make optional from preferences. is this possible?)
- material previews. henry said i shouldn't try it because it will make the leditor very slow but I Don't Care.
  (i  mean i do care, i just think i can make it run reasonably fast by using spatial partitioning)
- autotiles
  - option to join only inner tiles
  - ability to recognize more than one tile as a direction type
  - cross beams autotile
    - ability to constrain autotile shape into a square

- help pages/hints/tooltips/whatever
- tile cat# and index# saving is probably incorrect

Geometry Editor:

- select and move geometry (make in conjunction with copy/paste)
- keyboard shortcut for shortcut & shortcut dots

Light Editor:
- toggle view shadow plane and occlusion plane
- prop/tile as brush

Effects Editor:
- WASD navigation
- only store the pixels that changed in the matrix

Prop Editor:
- do tile as prop depth change based on if specs2 is active?
- More tiles are located in startUp.lingo... also check out initDRInternal in comEditorUtils.lingo
- correct flipping of multiple props or freeform props
  freeform props should flip about the center of the AABB
