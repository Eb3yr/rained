Priority:
- configurable tile spec colors
- "General" and "Current" shortcut split
- dissolve material/tile separation
- fix trans flag prop loading
- thin pipe join pipes not in path
- std path intersections
- more autotiles
  - wall wires
  - crossbeams?
  - fences
  - crawl holes

Bugs:
- drizzle doesn't build correctly on mac?
- need to crop asset graphics to be accurate to og editor
- change history doesn't work well with level resize
- crashes when calling UnloadMesh on Debian Linux
- effects list change recorder doesn't work?
- weird graphical issue on certain drivers when level is out of bounds

Overall:
- figure out github actions to make nightly builds
- favorite tiles and props
- code cleanup (RainEd.cs is like 1000 lines long... maybe also use subscriber pattern for subwindow updating?)
  also use function/class summaries
- move away from Raylib, perhaps use a single windowing/graphics library like SFML or Silk.NET or Veldrid
- rect/material tile place
- auto-recovery saves (main problem is figuring out how to do it non-blocking)
  - probably just create a copy of the level on the main thread, and save it on another? still would probably freeze app for a bit
- combine geo and tile editor
- check for latest version using https://api.github.com/repos/pkhead/rained/releases/latest
  (idk how to do this, it returns a 403 Forbidden)
- port newmakelevel (geometry exporter) to C#
- Move Level
- level preview in file browser
- undo/redo for level resize
- level resze drag
- help pages/hints/tooltips/whatever
- tile cat# and index# saving is probably incorrect
- option to use "legacy" shortcut icons

Geometry Editor:
- select and copy/paste
- show tool preview over mouse
- select and move geometry (make in conjunction with copy/paste)
- ability to view tiles (hm... what if i combined geo/tile editor?)
- keyboard shortcut for shortcut & shortcut dots
- optimized cell change recorder
  (i.e. record specific changes in user code instead of scanning the entire level for such)
  (though, after implementing LevelCell.Equals manually, the pause is barely noticeable)

NOTE: shortcut entrances always have an object of type 4. (dunno why, probably some leftovers from an older impl)

Tile Editor:
- make 2nd geo spec layer a lighter red 
- optimize tile rendering
- force geo on materials (hm... what if i combined geo/tile editor?)
- G+right click is buggy with specs2 (really?)
- tool to fix detached tile bodies

Camera Editor:
- render order

Light Editor:
- save intermediate textures for change history
  (i guess once per every 1000 stroke atoms or something)
- toggle view shadow plane and occlusion plane
- prop/tile as brush

Effects Editor:
- WASD navigation
- only store the pixels that changed in the matrix

Prop Editor:
- do tile as prop depth change based on if specs2 is active?
- More tiles are located in startUp.lingo... also check out initDRInternal in comEditorUtils.lingo
- correct flipping of multiple props or freeform props
  freeform props should flip about the center of the AABB
- randomFlipX and randomFlipY tags

Render:
- select camera to render first
- show time elapsed

tile data format (from rwe+):

    N = material name
