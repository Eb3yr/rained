Overall:
- proper splash screen window (make initial borderless undecorated window, then Raylib window with loading)
  use SFML for the splash screen window
- implement ShowError
- saving/loading
- undo/redo
- what if everything was on one screen?
- help pages/hints/tooltips/whatever
- arrow keys to scroll
- RenderGrid and RenderTile take in window view data instead of being sent it
  when functions are being called
- need a way for mouse to pan without mmb (accessibility purposes)

Level Properties:

Geometry Editor:
- select and copy/paste
- ability to view tiles
- shortcut entrance points towards any shortcut-related object (room entrance, den, scavenger hole,)
- right-click to remove selected tool
  (redundancy is good)
- OPTIMIZATION: render level in chunks, only re-render updated chunks

NOTE: shortcut entrances always have an object of type 4. (dunno why, probably some leftovers from an older impl)

Tile Editor:
- material brush size
- press E for tile/material eyedropper
- WASD tile palette navigation (emulates joar editor controls)
- draw culling

Camera Editor:
- moving cameras, adding cameras,
- camera corner manipulation, all that jazz


tile data format (from rwe+):
    {"tp": "tileHead", "data": ["point(C, T)", "N"]}
    C = Category ID (starting from 1) plus 2 (Stone = 3, Machinery = 15, Misc = 12)
    T = Tile index starting from 1
    N = tile name

    {"tp": "tileBody", "data": ["PT", L]}
    PT = location of the tile head plus (1, 1)
    L = layer

    {"tp": "material", "data": "N"}
    N = material name

    {"tp": "default": "data": 0}
