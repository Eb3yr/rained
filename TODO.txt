Bugs:
- client code mouse position doesn't work with multi-viewport

Overall:
- palette on props
- dissolve material/tile separation
- prop selection box is affected by bfTiles (don't do this)
- autotile joining
  - option to join only inner tiles
  - ability to recognize more than one tile as a direction type
- new level screen
- favorite tiles and props
- Move Level
- undo/redo for level resize
- level resze drag
- level resize change history
- help pages/hints/tooltips/whatever
- tile cat# and index# saving is probably incorrect
- option to use "legacy" shortcut icons
- put asterik in window title for unsaved levels
- ability to have more than one level loaded at once

Geometry Editor:
- select and copy/paste
- show tool preview over mouse
- select and move geometry (make in conjunction with copy/paste)
- keyboard shortcut for shortcut & shortcut dots

Light Editor:
- toggle view shadow plane and occlusion plane
- prop/tile as brush

Effects Editor:
- WASD navigation
- only store the pixels that changed in the matrix

Prop Editor:
- do tile as prop depth change based on if specs2 is active?
- More tiles are located in startUp.lingo... also check out initDRInternal in comEditorUtils.lingo
- correct flipping of multiple props or freeform props
  freeform props should flip about the center of the AABB
