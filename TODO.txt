KNOWN BUGS:
  App always assume Drizzle data directory is in src/Data.
  When published, there should not be a src directory...

Overall:
- undo/redo for level resize
- use c#10 records for some cases? they seem to fit my needs
- open file browser in directory of current level
- help pages/hints/tooltips/whatever
- Edit/View menu buttons for specific editors
  e.g. New Camera button in camera editor,
  no copy/paste in light/effects editor
- copy henry
  (if i were to add a new level config screen, add bool toggle to auto-place cameras)
  (that is the specific thing i want to copy)

Level Properties:

Geometry Editor:
- Fissure
- select and copy/paste
- ability to view tiles
- right-click to remove cells/objects
- OPTIMIZATION: render level in chunks, only re-render updated chunks

NOTE: shortcut entrances always have an object of type 4. (dunno why, probably some leftovers from an older impl)

Tile Editor:
- material brush size
- press E for tile/material eyedropper
- WASD tile palette navigation (emulates joar editor controls)
- rect material place
- copy henry
  (use two selectable lists for tile category and tile name)
- draw culling

Camera Editor:
- way to duplicate camera corner transform
- Select a camera first, then transform corners

Environment Editor:
- load seed and light type
- undo/redo

Light Editor:
- light parameters undo/redo
- light ring
- IJKL light parameter changing
- WASD catalog navigation
- save intermediate textures for change history
  (i guess once per every 1000 stroke atoms or something)
- toggle view shadow plane and occlusion plane

Effects Editor:
- undo/redo
- show light render stage
- if possible, show coloring stage, although i don't think
  drizzle has the code required to show that?

Prop Editor: (TODO)
- instead of using keys to rotate/scale props, user will place them down first
  and then use handles on the edge of the prop to rotate/scale them.
  (i think this is fine, although i haven't done much prop editing myself
  ...or much leditor experience in general...)
- rope-type props will have a "Simulate" button in an always-visible prop properties field.
  holding down this button will perform the simulation for as long as it is held.
- for rope-type props, copy henry's design

Render:
- show time elapsed

tile data format (from rwe+):
    {"tp": "tileHead", "data": ["point(C, T)", "N"]}
    C = Category ID (starting from 1) plus 2 (Stone = 3, Machinery = 15, Misc = 12)
    T = Tile index starting from 1
    N = tile name

    {"tp": "tileBody", "data": ["PT", L]}
    PT = location of the tile head plus (1, 1)
    L = layer

    {"tp": "material", "data": "N"}
    N = material name

    {"tp": "default": "data": 0}

effects matrix format
  {
    #nm: string
    #tp: "nn" | "standardErosion" (don't really know what this means),
    #crossScreen: 0 (idk what this means, but it is effect-specific),
    #mtrx: (2d array with values ranging from 0 to 100)
    #Options: [
      [
        section Header as string,
        options as string array (no options = empty array),
        selected value? (string, but a number is used for seed)
      ]
    ],

    [if #tp == "standardErosion"] (
      #repeats: number (idk what this does, but it is effect-specific)
      #affectOpenAreas: number (idk what this does either, but it is effect-specific)
    )
  }
