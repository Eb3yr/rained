Overall:
- proper splash screen window (make initial borderless undecorated window, then Raylib window with loading)
- saving/loading
- undo/redo
- what if everything was on one screen?

Level Properties:

Geometry Editor:
- arrow keys to scroll
- select and copy/paste

Tile Editor:
- tile editor can place required geometry



tile data format (from rwe+):
    {"tp": "tileHead", "data": ["point(C, T)", "N"]}
    C = Category ID (starting from 1) plus 2 (Stone = 3, Machinery = 15, Misc = 12)
    T = Tile index starting from 1
    N = tile name

    {"tp": "tileBody", "data": ["PT", 1]}
    PT = location of the tile head plus (1, 1)
    I don't know what the number means im assuming it's always 1

    {"tp": "material", "data": "N"}
    N = material name

    {"tp": "default": "data": 0}
