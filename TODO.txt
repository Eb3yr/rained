Overall:
- some levels fail to load
  (i assume this is because the editor is supposed to ignore erroneous lines...)
- saving
- help pages/hints/tooltips/whatever
- Edit/View menu buttons for specific editors
  e.g. New Camera button in camera editor,
  no copy/paste in light/effects editor

Level Properties:

Geometry Editor:
- select and copy/paste
- ability to view tiles
- right-click to remove cells/objects
- OPTIMIZATION: render level in chunks, only re-render updated chunks

NOTE: shortcut entrances always have an object of type 4. (dunno why, probably some leftovers from an older impl)

Tile Editor:
- correct tile rendering (render tile bodies instead of only tile heads)
- material brush size
- press E for tile/material eyedropper
- WASD tile palette navigation (emulates joar editor controls)
- copy henry
  (use two selectable lists for tile category and tile name)
- draw culling

Camera Editor:
- way to duplicate camera corner transform
- Select a camera first, then transform corners

Environment Editor:
- load seed and light type
- undo/redo

Light Editor:
- light parameters undo/redo
- light ring
- IJKL light parameter changing
- WASD catalog navigation
- save intermediate textures for change history
  (i guess once per every 1000 stroke atoms or something)
- toggle view shadow plane and occlusion plane

Effects Editor: (TODO)

Prop Editor: (TODO)
- instead of using keys to rotate/scale props, user will place them down first
  and then use handles on the edge of the prop to rotate/scale them.
  (i think this is fine, although i haven't done much prop editing myself
  ...or much leditor experience in general...)
- rope-type props will have a "Simulate" button in an always-visible prop properties field.
  holding down this button will perform the simulation for as long as it is held.


tile data format (from rwe+):
    {"tp": "tileHead", "data": ["point(C, T)", "N"]}
    C = Category ID (starting from 1) plus 2 (Stone = 3, Machinery = 15, Misc = 12)
    T = Tile index starting from 1
    N = tile name

    {"tp": "tileBody", "data": ["PT", L]}
    PT = location of the tile head plus (1, 1)
    L = layer

    {"tp": "material", "data": "N"}
    N = material name

    {"tp": "default": "data": 0}
